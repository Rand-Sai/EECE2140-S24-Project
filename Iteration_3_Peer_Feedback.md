Peer Review Feed back - Iteration 3

Overall good result - Too basic and straight forward
-Considering adding a GUI for the program to make it more fun
-Maybe consider to add feature allowing the user to name the png generated?
-Considering add feature allowing the user to make the png in different color? if acheivable.
